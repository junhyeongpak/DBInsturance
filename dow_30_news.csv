BA,1709330911,Boeing seeks 'quickest path to quality' with Spirit AeroSystems buy,Yahoo,"Boeing (BA) has confirmed it is in talks to acquire Spirit AeroSystems (SPR) amid its 737 Max safety woes, per the Wall Street Journal.  S&P Global Ratings Director Ben Tsocanos and Bloomberg Intelligence Airline Analyst George Ferguson join Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the potential acquisition. Ferguson says that if the 737 Max challenges persist, buying Spirit provides the ""quickest path to quality"" by overhauling Boeing's supply chain oversight. While competitive hurdles arise, he believes integrating Spirit is ""absolutely critical"" to fixing quality control issues. However, Tsocanos notes a big ""obstacle"" regulators may see is from Boeing insourcing key parts it sells to rivals today. Bringing Spirit in-house may ""simplify the quality control process,"" for Boeing's quality control but raises conflicts of interest.

AAPL,1709384443,Tony Robbins reveals his top secrets for successful investing,Yahoo,"When the hype is reaching new heights, it may be a good time to reach for the tried and true. As the S&P 500 (^GSPC) sets new records and ""Magnificent Seven"" trades such as Nvidia (NVDA) sail past red to white hot, remember to keep an even keel, advised life and business strategist Tony Robbins. ""If a Ferrari was on sale for 70% off, you'd buy it. But when your favorite stock is, people freak out. And when the thing is too expensive, they want to buy it,"" Robbins told Yahoo Finance. ""It's the crazy part of humanity."" Long-term fortunes are not built on a single asset class, let alone a single industry. Diversification is key to wealth generation, said Robbins, who has interviewed the likes of billionaires Ray Dalio, Robert Smith, and Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK-A, BRK-B) Warren Buffett. His latest book, ""The Holy Grail of Investing,"" digs into the power of alternative assets in a world obsessed with stocks. ""There [are] 250,000 companies that are from a $100 million to $3 billion [in value] that private equity can step into,"" said Robbins. ""Instead of trying to evaluate [the Magnificent Seven], create the diversification for yourself. So you reduce your risk by 80%."" His other tip for success includes turning a consumer mindset into an investor mindset: Those iPhone upgrades will cost you thousands, but a pile of Apple (AAPL) stock can set you up for the future. And regardless of where you're sitting in life, staying hungry can turn a losing tide — or extend a winning streak. ""If you're hungry, you'll find the answers. If you're hungry, you'll push through,"" said Robbins.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=e227da5b8357eced0d902d8b61e36e9e056eade0d8a9c564090c9d5737ffa139

MSFT,1709591566,Gen AI and the Mag 7: The battle for AI dominance heats up,Yahoo,"Nvidia (NVDA) has reached an all-time high in trading and shows few signs of slowing down. But are there opportunities in the sector for other companies to make an intervention? Constellation Research founder and analyst R ""Ray"" Wang and TD Cowen managing director and senior equity research analyst John Blackledge join the Live show to discuss the future of the Magnificent Seven tech stocks and what investors need to keep in mind with so many possibilities in the sector. While Apple (AAPL) has made forays into generative AI, investors say they want more. Wang, however, sees existing potential, such as the expansion of Apple Ferret, an open-source machine learning model, and Apple chips with built-in AI. He signals that the recent regulations levied against Apple rom the Europe Union might affect AI stocks moving forward: ""The challenge with AI and regulatory bodies is this is the opportunity for an aspiring politician to save the world and help us with privacy and stop big tech. And without understanding the cost/benefit analysis of what they're going up against. So you are going to see a lot more regulatory pressure and headwinds that are going to affect a lot of these tech companies, especially as government wants to get involved in the regulatory aspect of AI because tech is one of the few industries that is so lightly regulated compared to everything else."" Blackledge elaborates on the nature of competition between tech companies in their pursuit of generative AI: ""Microsoft (MSFT) and OpenAI clearly won the headline battle last year for sure. Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL), as far as I was tracking, right, probably in February, March, start to go faster with it. They had some good announcements in IO last year, last May. Obviously we're talking about the Gemini launch and it is going to be a little bit uneven but I do believe it's there for them to do well and to benefit like I was saying earlier with their cloud business, for enterprises and small business, and then with their Gemini suite of products for consumers. I agree, we've heard from all of our companies have reported. They're all using generative AI across their companies for internal functions and what not. We think Alphabet will be there for it. The pressure is definitely on."" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.

MSFT,1709384443,Tony Robbins reveals his top secrets for successful investing,Yahoo,"When the hype is reaching new heights, it may be a good time to reach for the tried and true. As the S&P 500 (^GSPC) sets new records and ""Magnificent Seven"" trades such as Nvidia (NVDA) sail past red to white hot, remember to keep an even keel, advised life and business strategist Tony Robbins. ""If a Ferrari was on sale for 70% off, you'd buy it. But when your favorite stock is, people freak out. And when the thing is too expensive, they want to buy it,"" Robbins told Yahoo Finance. ""It's the crazy part of humanity."" Long-term fortunes are not built on a single asset class, let alone a single industry. Diversification is key to wealth generation, said Robbins, who has interviewed the likes of billionaires Ray Dalio, Robert Smith, and Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK-A, BRK-B) Warren Buffett. His latest book, ""The Holy Grail of Investing,"" digs into the power of alternative assets in a world obsessed with stocks. ""There [are] 250,000 companies that are from a $100 million to $3 billion [in value] that private equity can step into,"" said Robbins. ""Instead of trying to evaluate [the Magnificent Seven], create the diversification for yourself. So you reduce your risk by 80%."" His other tip for success includes turning a consumer mindset into an investor mindset: Those iPhone upgrades will cost you thousands, but a pile of Apple (AAPL) stock can set you up for the future. And regardless of where you're sitting in life, staying hungry can turn a losing tide — or extend a winning streak. ""If you're hungry, you'll find the answers. If you're hungry, you'll push through,"" said Robbins.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=e227da5b8357eced0d902d8b61e36e9e056eade0d8a9c564090c9d5737ffa139

XOM,1708983201,Salesforce history: Beyond the Ticker,Yahoo,"Over the past quarter of a century, Salesforce (CRM) has become one of the global leaders in the cloud-based software industry. In 2022 alone, Salesforce's revenue topped $31 billion, a more than 18% year-over-year increase. But what led to Salesforce's growth in the cloud computing industry? Beyond the Ticker takes a closer look at some of the company's biggest moments. 1999 Salesforce was founded by former Oracle executive Marc Benioff, Parker Harris, Dave Moellenhoff, and Frank Dominguez, specializing in software as a service (SaaS). 2000 The dot com bubble burst, and the company was forced to lay off 20% of its employees. On February 7, 2000, Salesforce.com officially launched an event themed around “The End of Software” at San Francisco’s Regency Theater featuring The B-52s. 2003 Salesforce continued to grow, with its revenue skyrocketing to over $100 million by December 2003. 2004 In June 2004, the company went public via initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange at $11 per share. 2009 Salesforce had an annual revenue of just over $1 billion. That same year, Salesforce launched Service Cloud for customer service and support automation. 2014 Salesforce debuted Trailhead, a free online learning platform empowering anyone — regardless of education level — to develop the skills needed to land top tech jobs. 2016 The company launched Einstein, the first comprehensive artificial intelligence (AI) technology for customer relationship management (CRM), making AI accessible to every company and business user. 2020 Salesforce was added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), replacing energy giant ExxonMobil (XOM). 2021 Salesforce completed the acquisition of Slack for $27.7 billion, its largest acquisition to date. 2023 The company introduced the next generation of Einstein AI, Einstein GPT, the world’s first generative AI for CRM. From its humble beginnings to a market cap of over $276 billion, Salesforce now stands as one of the world's most distinguished software companies. From tech giants to retail titans, Beyond the Ticker is a historical series that takes a deep dive into some of Wall Street's trending companies and how they transformed into the financial icons they are today.
